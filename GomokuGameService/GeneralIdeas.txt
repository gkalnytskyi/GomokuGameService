# General Design Ideas

Service allows to play a game of Gomoku.
1. Service can contain only one Gomoku game at a time.
2. Game state is stored in memory.
3. User calls a service to start a new game. Calling new game when another one is active
   resets all progress.
4. Service controls which player goes. If the wrong player goes, error is returned,
   but state of the game doesn't change.
5. Game ends when either there is a row of 5 adjacent same color "stones" on the horizontal,
   vertical, or diagonal line, or if there is no empty board cell to place a stone.
6. Black go first.
7. Winner is the one who put a row of 5 adjacent same color "stones" first. If the last
   stone is placed, but there are no 5 "stone" rows where created it is a draw.
